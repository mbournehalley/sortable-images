# Project Overview

Create a webpage that displays a gallery of images, given a JSON array containing a list of image URLs.
Here are the requirements:
* Do not use any Javascript libraries or frameworks for your webpage. Javascript build tools are ok.
* ES5 or above is preferred.
* The basic layout should be a grid of pictures.
* The images should be reorder-able by dragging and dropping. Dragging an image to a new position should insert that image at the new position, and maintain order of other images. It should not swap images.
* Any other functionality is not expected.
* The submitted code should be runnable and viewable. Add any instructions necessary to a README.md file. You are provided with a directory of sample pictures for convenience.
